# Machine Learning Midterm Project: Peer Review

## Project Reviewed: Beaderstadt UCI Mushroom Dataset: Classification Machine Learning Midterm
**Author:** Alissa Beaderstadt
**Date:** November 6, 2025 
**Objective:** Analyze the work done in this project and give feedback within the four sections below.

### 1 Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)

I appreciated the project flow and additional sub sections.  For example Section 6 was well laid out and summarized the findings well.


### 2 Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)

There were a lot of features to choose from.  I think the graphs were important to help decide which features to use in the model.  I think the selections were made thoughtfully and that decision worked all well as seen in the results.


### 3 Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)

Probably the oddest thing I see was the results were the same both for the Decision Tree and Random Forest models.  That seems strange to me, but makes me think that the nine poisonous misclassified as edible really had characteristics like the edible mushrooms in the features selected for the model. 

I think if any more improvement were needed more features would need to be introduced to the model.  I would have liked to hear Alissa's comments on this point.


### 4 Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)

I found the reflections very informative and helpful.  I had never seen this dataset before, and I feel I have a good understanding of it now after reading through Alissa's midterm project.
